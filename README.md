Rock Paper Scissors
A simple and fun game built using React, SCSS, and the Context Hook. The game features a scoreboard on top that keeps track of the user's wins, losses, and draws, a "Rules" button in the bottom that displays the rules in a modal when clicked, and a middle section where the user can select their move (rock, paper, or scissors) and see the result of the game.

The game is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, so you can play on any device.

Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

Copy code
npm install
npm start
This will start a development server and open the game in your browser.

How to Play
Click on one of the images (rock, paper, or scissors) to make your move.
The game will randomly select a move for the computer and determine the winner.
The scoreboard on top will update with the result and the user's new score.
If you want to play again, simply click the "Play Again" button and the game will reset.
To view the rules of the game, click the "Rules" button in the bottom of the screen.
Built With
React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
